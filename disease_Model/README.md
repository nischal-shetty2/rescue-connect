## Animal Skin Disease Detection Model
This repository contains an open-source machine learning model for detecting skin diseases in animals, we also create this repositories in order to fulfilled documentation on our project at Bangkit Capstone Project 2023. The model is trained using a deep learning architecture and has achieved high accuracy in identifying various skin conditions in different animal species. 

## Model Description
The skin disease detection model leverages state-of-the-art deep learning techniques to analyze animal skin images and classify them into different disease categories. It has been trained on a diverse dataset, carefully curated from a wide range of animal species, encompassing common and rare skin conditions.

Key features of the model:

* Utilizes convolutional neural networks (CNN) to extract relevant features from animal skin images.
* Employs transfer learning with a pre-trained neural network architecture to enhance generalization and performance.
* Achieves high accuracy and robustness in detecting a variety of skin diseases in animals.

## Replication Steps
To replicate the steps and use the model for your own research or applications, please follow these instructions:

* **Data Preparation:** Collect or acquire a dataset of animal skin images annotated with corresponding disease labels. Ensure a diverse representation of species and skin conditions for optimal model performance.

* **Environment Setup:** Set up a Python environment with the required dependencies listed in the requirements.txt file.

* **Model Training:** Run the provided training script, specifying the path to your prepared dataset. Tweak hyperparameters such as learning rate, batch size, and number of training epochs as needed.

* **Model Evaluation:** Evaluate the trained model's performance using standard evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Evaluate the model on a separate validation dataset to assess its generalization capability.

* **Inference:** Use the trained model to make predictions on new animal skin images. Preprocess the images as required (e.g., resizing, normalization) and pass them through the model for disease detection.

For detailed instructions and code snippets, please refer to the documentation provided in the repository.
